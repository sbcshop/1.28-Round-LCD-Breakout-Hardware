The 1.28” Round LCD breakout is colorful and easy to experiment with graphics. The display is of 240x240 resolution, IPS display, and 65k RGB colors to create a colorful user interface for your project. The breakout can be powered with 5V or 3.3V, making it versatile with any controller or processor board like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Pico, STM32, Rock Pi, etc.

1.28” Round LCD is based on the GC9A01 display driver and we have created multiple examples to play with it. Using the SPI interface you can program it with any of your boards. It comes with 8 Pin male header pins for the soldering.
